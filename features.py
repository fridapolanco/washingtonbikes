      - **User Type Insights**: These ratios reveal the mix of casual versus registered users in each record. Casual users likely represent occasional rentals, such as by tourists, while registered users might indicate regular commuters. This differentiation helps in understanding various user behaviors.
      - **Demand Patterns**: The ratios help analyze how factors like time of day, day of the week, or weather conditions affect each user group differently. For example, casual rentals might increase on weekends or in good weather, while registered users may maintain more consistent usage.
      - **Predictive Power**: Adding these ratios enhances the model by capturing demand composition. Rather than treating casual and registered counts separately, the ratios provide a structured view of their contributions to total demand (`cnt`), potentially boosting model accuracy in predicting total rentals.

    - The `dteday` column is converted to datetime format to standardize date representation, enabling easy extraction of additional time-based features like day of the week or month.
    - A new index for our DataFrame `data`is created by combining `dteday` (date) and `hr` (hour) into a single hourly timestamp. This index  reflects each observation‚Äôs exact hour and provides a continuous, time-structured feature that enhances temporal analysis, allowing the model to capture patterns based on specific hours, days, or longer cycles. This structure supports chronological ordering, facilitating time-based operations such as resampling or lagging.
      - **Sort Data by Index (`date`)**: Sorting the data by the `date` index ensures records are in chronological order, which is critical for time-series modeling and prevents any misalignment of records when analyzing or visualizing temporal trends.

    - The `hr` (hour) column is transformed into a new categorical feature, `TOD` (Time of Day), by grouping hours into four bins: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night as it is more user-friendly.

        - Morning: 6 AM - 12 PM
        - Afternoon: 12 PM - 5 PM
        - Evening: 5 PM - 9 PM
        - Night: 9 PM - 6 AM
      - By creating `TOD`, we add context to each record regarding daily activity patterns, such as commuting times (Morning, Evening) or leisure periods (Afternoon, Night). This simplifies analysis by capturing time-of-day effects, which can be more meaningful for identifying patterns than the exact hour.

        - Not Rush: All other hours
      - By creating the `Rush` feature, we add context to each record regarding peak traffic times, such as morning and evening commuting hours. This allows the model to capture demand patterns linked to higher activity periods, as rush hours are likely to have different demand levels compared to non-rush times.

    - The `windspeed` column is transformed into a new categorical feature, `Wind`, by grouping wind speeds into three categories: Low, Medium, and High.

        - Low: Wind speed less than 10
        - Medium: Wind speed between 10 and 20
        - High: Wind speed above 20
      - By creating the `Wind` feature, we add context to each record about weather conditions, which can influence user behavior and demand. For example, higher wind speeds might reduce bike rentals, while lower speeds may have a minimal effect. This categorization simplifies the analysis by capturing the impact of different wind conditions on bike usage.

        - Medium: humidity level between .31 and .6
        - High: humidity level above .6

      - **Dropping Missing Values**: Since the first row in `prev_count` will be `NaN` (no prior hour data for the first entry), rows with missing values are removed.
      - By creating `prev_count`, we allow the model to recognize patterns influenced by the previous hour‚Äôs activity, which is often useful in time-series forecasting. For example, a high count in the previous hour may indicate sustained demand, helping the model predict demand continuity or fluctuation more effectively.

                Our ML framework was designed to be intuitive and graspable. Our core approach involved using PyCarret to analyze a variety of various regression models, ranging from tree based regressors to classic linear regression. 

To set up our experiment, we chose a variety of variables including things like wind speed, temperature, day of week, hour and month. Practically all variables were categorical (e.g. Day of Week, Rush Hour, Hour, etc.), and the numerical variables surrounding wind speed were binned into categorical variables as well. PyCarret automatically one-hot-encodes these variables, so we tried to use them for non-ordinal variables.

A notable exception is the weathersit variable, which though categorical has a clear ordinality in the various classes. This was kept numerical to preserve the information of order.

As far as notable settings go, our data was a time series, and thus our cross validation approach reflected as much. Furthermore, we added a metric to tune our model we call ‚ÄúWeighted R2‚Äù, a metric that punishes under-prediction more than over-correction. This comes from the business logic that having too many bikes is a smaller issue than having too few.
